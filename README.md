## DESCRIPTION ##
"Lost Echoes" is an immersive text-based adventure game that takes players on a captivating journey of self-discovery and survival. Set within the mysterious confines of an enigmatic cave, the game introduces a protagonist who awakens with no memory of their past or how they ended up there.

With the determination, players embark on a quest to unravel the truth behind their imprisonment in the cave and find a way back home.

The game unfolds across four engrossing chapters, each unveiling new layers of the protagonist's identity and purpose. Starting with their awakening in darkness, players navigate the treacherous cave, solving puzzles, avoiding traps, and facing unexpected challenges. Along the way, they discover clues, encounter remnants of previous inhabitants, and gather fragments of memories that shed light on their past.

As the story progresses, the protagonist uncovers a sinister plot and encounters mysterious entities that guard the secrets within the cave's depths. They must harness their unique abilities and make choices that shape their destiny. The game incorporates branching paths, allowing players to make decisions that influence the story's outcome, leading to multiple possible endings.

"Lost Echoes" captivates players with its atmospheric setting, engaging storyline, and the freedom to shape the protagonist's fate. Will you uncover the truth, confront your captor, and find your way back home, or will the echoes of the cave forever haunt your journey? The answers lie within the depths of the darkness, waiting to be discovered.
